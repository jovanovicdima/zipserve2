Create a web server that generates a zip archive for requested files and returns it to the client.
All requests to the server are sent via a browser using the GET method.
In the request, the names of the files to be archived are specified as parameters.
If any of the specified files do not exist on the server, the other files are archived.
If none of the requested files exist on the server, a message is displayed to the client.
Use the SharpZipLib library to create the zip archive (this library can be installed using the NuGet package manager).

Example server call: http://localhost:8080/test1.txt&test2.txt&test3.txt
